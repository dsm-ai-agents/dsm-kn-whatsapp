- Complex technical support beyond bot capabilities: "I have a complex integration issue that needs debugging"
- Complaints requiring human empathy: "I'm very frustrated with this service"
- Account-specific issues: "There's a billing problem with my account", "I need to change my subscription"
- Situations requiring human judgment: "I need to negotiate terms", "This is a special case"

NO HANDOVER NEEDED (requires_human: false):
- Questions about bot memory/capabilities: "What's my name?", "Do you remember what I told you?", "What company do I work for?"
- Product information requests: "Tell me about your pricing", "How does this feature work?"
- General questions: "Can you explain this?", "What are the benefits?"
- Requests for information the bot can provide: "Can you send me documentation?", "What are your hours?"
- Testing bot functionality: "Do you know who I am?", "What did I tell you earlier?"
