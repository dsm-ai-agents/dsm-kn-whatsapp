# üéØ Lead Qualification & Calendly Integration System

## Overview

The **Lead Qualification & Calendly Integration System** is an AI-powered feature that automatically analyzes user messages to identify qualified business leads and sends them personalized Calendly discovery call invitations. This system works alongside the existing handover system to create a complete lead management workflow.

## üöÄ How It Works

### **1. AI-Powered Lead Analysis**
When a user sends a message, the system:
- ‚úÖ **Analyzes business intent** using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- ‚úÖ **Scores lead quality** from 0-100 points
- ‚úÖ **Identifies buying signals** and business indicators
- ‚úÖ **Provides confidence ratings** for decision making

### **2. Smart Lead Qualification**
The AI looks for these key indicators:

#### **üéØ Business Intent Signals**
- Looking for business solutions/services
- Asking about pricing, packages, or business plans
- Mentioning business problems or challenges
- Discussing implementation, integration, or adoption
- Questions like "how does this work for business"

#### **üí∞ Buying Signals**
- Timeline questions ("when can we start", "how long does it take")
- Budget-related inquiries
- Decision-making language ("we need", "looking for")
- Comparison shopping ("vs competitors")
- Implementation questions

#### **üè¢ Business Context**
- Mentions company size, industry, or role
- Discusses team needs or requirements
- References current tools/systems
- Talks about scaling or growth

#### **üî• Engagement Level**
- Asks detailed questions
- Shows genuine interest beyond basic info
- Responds with specific use cases
- Provides context about their situation

### **3. Automatic Calendly Integration**
When a qualified lead is detected:
- ‚úÖ **Personalized invitation** based on lead quality (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- ‚úÖ **Professional messaging** with clear value proposition
- ‚úÖ **Calendly link** automatically included
- ‚úÖ **CRM updates** with lead scoring and activity logging

## üìä Lead Quality Classifications

### **üî• HIGH Quality (80-100 points)**
- Strong business intent + clear buying signals + high engagement
- **Gets**: Personalized professional invitation with specific value props
- **Priority**: High priority in CRM
- **Response**: "Great to connect with a fellow business professional!"

### **‚ö° MEDIUM Quality (60-79 points)**
- Some business indicators + decent engagement
- **Gets**: Friendly invitation focusing on understanding needs
- **Priority**: Medium priority in CRM
- **Response**: "Thanks for your interest in our business solutions!"

### **üí° LOW Quality (40-59 points)**
- Limited business context or buying signals
- **Gets**: Simple invitation for consultation
- **Priority**: Standard follow-up
- **Response**: "Thank you for your interest!"

### **‚ùå NOT QUALIFIED (0-39 points)**
- No business intent or engagement indicators
- **Gets**: No Calendly invitation
- **Action**: Continue with normal bot conversation

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### **Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Lead Qualification Settings
LEAD_QUALIFICATION_ENABLED=true
LEAD_QUALIFICATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75
LEAD_QUALIFICATION_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
LEAD_QUALIFICATION_LOGGING_ENABLED=true

# Calendly Integration
CALENDLY_DISCOVERY_CALL_URL=https://calendly.com/your-company/discovery-call
CALENDLY_AUTO_SEND_ENABLED=true

# Lead Scoring
QUALIFIED_LEAD_MIN_SCORE=70
DISCOVERY_CALL_LEAD_SCORE_BOOST=30
```

### **Key Settings Explained**

- **`LEAD_QUALIFICATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75`**: AI must be 75% confident before qualifying a lead
- **`QUALIFIED_LEAD_MIN_SCORE=70`**: Lead must score 70+ points to be qualified
- **`DISCOVERY_CALL_LEAD_SCORE_BOOST=30`**: Qualified leads get +30 points in CRM
- **`CALENDLY_DISCOVERY_CALL_URL`**: Your actual Calendly scheduling link

## üìã Database Setup

Run the migration to set up required tables:

```bash
# Apply the database migration
psql -d your_database -f database_migration_lead_qualification.sql
```

This creates:
- ‚úÖ **`lead_qualification_log`** table for AI analysis logging
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced `contacts`** table with discovery call tracking
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced `lead_details`** table with qualification metadata
- ‚úÖ **Analytics views** for monitoring performance

## üéØ Message Processing Flow

Here's how the system integrates with your existing WhatsApp bot:

```
1. User sends message
   ‚Üì
2. Check for handover request (existing)
   ‚Üì (if no handover needed)
3. üÜï LEAD QUALIFICATION ANALYSIS
   ‚Üì
4. If qualified ‚Üí Send Calendly + Update CRM
   ‚Üì
5. Continue with normal bot response
```

### **Integration Points**

The lead qualification happens:
- **After** handover detection (handover takes priority)
- **Before** normal bot response
- **Parallel** to conversation flow (doesn't interrupt user experience)
- **With context** from conversation history for better analysis

## üì± User Experience Examples

### **Example 1: HIGH Quality Lead**
**User**: *"Hi, we're a 50-person marketing agency looking for a WhatsApp automation solution. We're currently using basic tools but need something more robust for client communication. What's your pricing for business plans?"*

- Buying signals: ‚úÖ (specific use case, current tools)
- Business context: ‚úÖ (company size, industry)
- Engagement: ‚úÖ (detailed question)
- **Score**: 92/100 ‚Üí **HIGH quality**

    COUNT(*) as total_analyzed,
    SUM(CASE WHEN final_decision THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as qualified_count,

GROUP BY lead_quality
ORDER BY avg_confidence DESC;
```

### **Calendly Invitation Success Rate**
```sql
-- Discovery call invitation tracking
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT contact_id) as qualified_leads,
    SUM(CASE WHEN latest_calendly_activity IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as calendly_sent
FROM qualified_leads_summary;
```

## üéõÔ∏è Fine-tuning the System

### **Adjusting Sensitivity**

**More Aggressive (Qualify More Leads)**:
```bash
LEAD_QUALIFICATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6  # Lower threshold
QUALIFIED_LEAD_MIN_SCORE=60                   # Lower score requirement
```

**More Conservative (Qualify Fewer, Higher-Quality Leads)**:
```bash
LEAD_QUALIFICATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.85  # Higher threshold
QUALIFIED_LEAD_MIN_SCORE=80                    # Higher score requirement
```

### **Custom Calendly Messages**

Edit the messages in `lead_qualification_service.py`:
