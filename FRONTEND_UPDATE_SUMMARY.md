  - `display_phone` - Formatted phone number

### 2. **Conversation List** (`src/components/conversations/conversation-list.tsx`)
- Updated `getContactDisplayName()` to prioritize verified names
- Added profile image support in avatars
- Priority: `verified_name` > `name` > `company` > `formatted_phone`

### 3. **Conversation Item** (`src/components/conversations/conversation-item.tsx`)

- Added business account badge indicator
- Shows green "Business" badge for business accounts

### 4. **Conversation Detail** (`src/components/conversations/conversation-detail.tsx`)
- Updated header to show verified names
- Added business account indicator in header
- Updated avatar to show profile images
- Fallback to initials when no profile image

### 5. **Contact Info Panel** (`src/components/conversations/contact-info-panel.tsx`)
- Added profile image support in large avatar
- Shows verified names as primary display name
- Added business account indicator
- Shows WhatsApp status message if available

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Before Updates**
```
Conversations showing:
- John Doe (+91 70330 09600)
- Unknown Contact (+91 98765 43210)
- Contact from Tech Company (+91 87654 32109)
```

### **After Updates**
```
Conversations showing:
- John's Business [Business] (with profile image)

- Sarah Marketing Agency (with profile image)
- +91 98765 43210 (if no contact info available)
```

---

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Contact Name Priority**
1. **Verified Name** (from WASender API) - Highest priority
2. **Regular Name** (from local database)
3. **Company Name** (formatted as "Contact from {company}")
4. **Formatted Phone Number** (e.g., "+91 70330 09600")

### **Visual Indicators**
- **Profile Images**: Shows WhatsApp profile pictures when available
- **Business Badge**: Green "Business" badge for verified business accounts
- **WhatsApp Status**: Shows status message in contact info panel
- **Fallback Avatars**: Shows initials when no profile image available

### **Automatic Updates**
- Contact information updates automatically when backend syncs
- No manual refresh needed
- Profile images load dynamically
- Business indicators appear in real-time

## 🚀 **Testing the Updates**

### **1. Start the Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend/whatsappcrm
npm run dev
```

### **2. Check Conversations Page**
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/conversations`
- Look for verified business names instead of phone numbers
- Check for green "Business" badges
- Verify profile images are loading

### **3. Test Contact Info Panel**
- Click the info button in conversation detail
- Check large profile image display
- Verify verified name is shown
- Look for WhatsApp status message

### **4. Verify Fallbacks**
- Contacts without verified names should show regular names
- Contacts without profile images should show initials
- Phone numbers should be formatted nicely

---

## 🔍 **Debugging**

### **If Contact Names Don't Show**
1. Check if backend sync is working
2. Verify API response includes `verified_name` field
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure WASender API is configured correctly

### **If Profile Images Don't Load**
1. Check if `profile_image_url` is in API response
2. Verify image URLs are accessible
3. Check for CORS issues with image loading
4. Ensure images are properly formatted

### **If Business Badges Don't Show**
1. Check if `is_business_account` field is true
2. Verify business account detection in backend
3. Check CSS classes are applied correctly

---

## 📊 **Performance Considerations**

### **Image Loading**
- Profile images load asynchronously
- Fallback to initials while loading
- Images are cached by browser
- No impact on conversation loading speed

### **Data Fetching**
- Contact enrichment happens automatically
- No additional API calls needed
- Uses existing conversation API
- Real-time updates when sync completes

---

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

- ✅ Verified business names displayed as primary contact names
- ✅ Profile images loaded and displayed correctly
- ✅ Business account indicators visible
- ✅ WhatsApp status messages shown
- ✅ Proper fallbacks for missing data
- ✅ No performance impact on conversation loading

**The frontend is now fully integrated with WASender contact sync! 🚀**
